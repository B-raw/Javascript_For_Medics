An Introduction to Javascript for Clinician Developers

If you want to become a Frontend web developer then there is one more technology that you need to master - Javascript. Javascript is the technology that powers the web, anything that moves or interacts with the user or changes colour or does just about anything dynamic is going to be run by Javascript. You can use it to make games, web apps and in fact entire massive websites. It is probably the most popular programming language around today, and for good reason as it comes with a vast array of libraries, packages and frameworks (These things basically make it a lot easier to do stuff which is cool as a developer because time is your most precious asset.)

Before you get started I recommend you download the Atom text editor: https://atom.io/ as it is definitely the best frontend coding environment I have found (and I have tried out a LOT of them!). It will allow you to keep all your code tidy and help highlight any issues + it features certain predictive abilities which are not to be overlooked.

I also recommend the following resources to learn Javascript:

Sololearn App - www.sololearn.com - enables you to code on the go.
Codeacademy - www.codeacademy.com
Many of the courses on Udemy / Udacity / or any of the other major platforms are very good, but don't pay for one to learn CSS alone.
There are also numerous web based games that can teach you to code - particularly frontend based ones: https://skillcrush.com/2017/04/03/free-coding-games/

A note of advice: be patient with yourself, it takes time especially when working full time as a doctor. It took me months to get going, but trust me it is well worth it and you will never regret the investment you made in yourself ;)

After you master Javascript I guarantee you will be hooked and won't be able to look back. This is the point where a lot of people give up, but if you can get past this part you really start to reap the rewards ;)

If you have any questions just message me on facebook or join the clinical developers email list and send me a direct mail from there.

Happy coding!
